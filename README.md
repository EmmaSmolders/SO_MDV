These directories contain Python (v3) scripts for plotting/analysing model output.

Python scripts can be found in the directory 'Program'. Model output can be found in the directory 'Data'.

The processed model output are stored as NETCDF files and using the relevant scripts one can regenerate the figures. Some scripts (e.g., AMOC_streamfunction.py and APE.py) use the original model output (not given here), but the generated time series are already available in the relevant directories.
